## Course Description

Students learn fundamental concepts of modern operating systems by studying
how and why operating systems have evolved. Topics include CPU scheduling,
process synchronization, memory management, file systems, I/O systems,
privacy and security, and performance evaluation. Students implement parts of
an operating system as a means of exploring the details of some of these
topics. Students will also implement Linux kernel modules to explore the
interactions between user-space and kernel-space.

## Prerequisite Topics

It is assumed that students are familiar with the C programming language and
are well on their way to being independent programmers (i.e. they have a
solid command of the material in CSSE-220). It is also assumed that students
have an understanding of the material covered in CSSE-132 or CSSE-232
including interrupts and exceptions, the relationship between high-level
languages and assembly code, and processor resources such as registers.

## Deadlines and Late Policy

The deadlines of all homeworks, labs, and project milestones are listed on on the
[schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) page.

In general, you should plan ahead and submit assignments on time. This course has no ’late day’
policy and late assignments are generally worth 0 points unless you have made arrangements.

However we understand that situations can arise. We handle all situations on a case-by-case basis.
Here are some general guidelines:

* The usual extension is 24 hours upon request or for extreme circumstances 48 hours
* We expect to be notified as soon as is feasible. If you are very ill, we understand that that
might be slightly after the assignment due date. For other situations, it’s usually possible to
notify us in advance.
* We keep track of extensions per student and if you seem to be overusing the privilege we will stop
allowing extensions.
* If the reason you are late is because you are having trouble completing the assignment (e.g. a bug
you can’t fix or just difficulty understanding) get help from an instructor. Don’t assume that more
time will fix the problem; plan to get help.

## Special Arrangements

If circumstances have caused you to miss/fail several assignments OR if your current situation in OS
seems overwhelming, you should contact the professor right away.  Sometimes it is possible to make
up missed work for partial credit - these situations are always handled on a case-by-case basis.

The best chance of success is when these problems are addressed quickly - but it never hurts to have
a discussion, however unsalvageable the situation may feel.  Please talk to your professor if you
are having problems!

## Homework Assignments/Labs

Homework assignments, including Labs, are listed on the class
schedule. Some homework assignments require code solutions and
submission instructions can be found
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/submission_instructions/). Others
involve Moodle or paper and pencil solutions.

There are ~6 "regular" programming assignments, plus assorted Moodle
quizzes and minor assignments (you can see the exact weight of
everything in Moodle).  These assignments are integral to your
understanding of OS - missing any of them can make passing OS quite
hard.  All these assignments are done individually.

There is one term project consisting of three milestones spread across the entire quarter. This
project replaces the BareMetalOS assignments in the previous version of the class. I highly
recommend that you work on this assignment in pairs. Group members can be from either section 03 or
section 04.

There are also 6 ADVANCED assignments.  Advanced assignments generally
involve trickier programming but explore more interesting topics.
Despite the fact that they are harder, the advanced assignments are
actually weighted less than regular assignments.  If you're willing to
accept a C in the course, you don't have to do any advanced
assignments.  BUT it's our hope everyone will attempt at least some of
the advanced assignments, and those looking for an A will need to
complete nearly all of them.  Advanced assignments can be done in
groups of 2, or individually.

## Exams

There will be 2 skill exams.  Passing *each* exam is required to pass
the course (unless otherwise specified, passing means getting 65% or
better).  Each exam will have a makeup and the higher of the two exam
grades will be used.  However, if you fail both the exam and the
makeup, you fail the course.

## Grading

| Item                  | Weight |
| :-------------------- | :----- |
| Assignments/Labs      | 40%    |
| ADVANCED  Assignments | 14%    |
| Term Project          | 15%    |
| Exams                 | 30%    |
| Mystery               | 1%     |

The mystery item is left for you to figure out.

I generally follow the registrar's interpretation of letter grades, which you can find
[here](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/registrar/rules-and-procedures/grades.html)
under the grades description section.

* NOTE: You must pass each skill exam (usually 65% or better) to pass the course 

## Handling Grading Issues

Most of the homeworks in this course are graded by TAs.  You should be able to see the TA who graded
your assignment on the course schedule AND the grade notification email that Moodle sends should
also identify them.  When you have a grading issue, please contact the grading TA
first...particularly for issues like:

+ The code you submitted works on your computer but not the TAs
+ The TA didn't notice but you actually did do the thing requested, it was just in a different place etc.
+ You submitted the wrong files

If you talk to the grading TA and you disagree with their analysis of your code or you feel the grading standards were unfair (or unfairly applied) please contact your instructor.  We want to help you but everything goes smoother if logistical issues come to the TAs first.

## Collaboration, Cheating and Professional Behavior

Collaboration is encouraged on homework and laboratories. It is prohibited on all quizzes and exams. When you collaborate, you must properly credit your collaborators and clearly indicate the extent of the collaboration. Working out a solution as a group is acceptable collaboration. Each individual is responsible for understanding the entire solution. For homework, this means that once a group solution has been achieved, each collaborator must rework the problem and write up the solution independently. Copying is not collaboration. Failure to properly acknowledge collaboration can be considered cheating.

Students found to have cheated will be penalized up to -150% of the value of the assignment (yes, that’s a negative grade, beyond a simple 0). This is in addition to cheating being reported and added to your permanent file.

Students are expected to behave professionally. A lack of professional behavior in a student’s interactions within a team, with an instructor, teaching assistants or during in-class activities can result in a penalty grade. Depending on the nature and the egregiousness of the behavior, the penalty grade might be a reduction in letter grade or an F in the class.
