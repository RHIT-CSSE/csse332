# Introduction and aim

In this session, we will have a brief introduction to computer security by
discussing the CIA triad, where C is for confidentiality, I is for integrity,
and A is for availability. We will then focus on integrity and discuss our
introduction to control flow hijacking attacks through the exposition of several
buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
