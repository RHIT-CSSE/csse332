# Introduction and aim
In this session, we will concretely define threads and learn how to use the `pthreads` library. We
will conduct a speed test to compare multithreading vs multiprocessing. Finally, we will take a look
at what are some common issues with multi-threaded applications so we can set up our dive into
concurrency.
