# Introduction and aim

In this session, we will start the new chapter of our CSSE332 journey, which is
a dive into the world of virtual memory. We will explore how the OS puts every
process under the illusion that it exclusively owns memory and can access
addresses in that memory region. 

We will look at two of the early methods to achieve memory virtualization:
1. Base and bound
2. Segmentation
