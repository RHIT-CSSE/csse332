# Introduction and aim

In this session, we will look at the distinction between kernel threads and user threads. We will
introduce and then talk about the benefits and disadvantages of each, and present three models of
thread management:
1. One-to-one mapping between user threads and kernel threads
2. Many-to-one mapping between user threads and kernel threads
3. Many-to-many mapping between user threads and kernel threads

We will implement the many-to-many mapping in our next advanced assignment (Hybrid threads).
