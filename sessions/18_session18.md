# Introduction and aim
In this session, we will start our conversation about semaphores. This is going to be mostly a
hands-on learning experience where we will do in-class activities together. We will start by
defining what a semaphore is and how we can use it, then we will apply semaphores directly through 4
examples in our in-class activity.
