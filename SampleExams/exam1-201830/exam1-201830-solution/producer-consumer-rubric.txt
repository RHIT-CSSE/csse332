Overall guidance

Part 1
5 points if they used syntax correctly and have some thread running
5 points if they have 2 threads running, with an approach at communication 
  that could work, but maybe some bugs.
5 points if they have it working perfectly

Examples:

10/15 Step2 chunk 0 doesn't start till Step1 chunk 1 ends
15/15 Uses a semaphore initialized with 0 that posts after production and 
  waits on construction (might not generalize to step 2 though)
10/15 segfaults due to semi-obvious bug, but works correctly if fixed
5/15 some threads created, but program exits because they were not joined

Part 2

MECHANICS
7 points if they used the mechanics of semaphores correctly
That is:
Semaphore is declared in a way all the appropriate parts of the system have 
  access to it (e.g. a global)
Semaphore is initialized with sem_init before use, with count set right 
  (almost certainly to 1)
Some critical section is protected with a sem_wait followed by a sem_post


CORRECTNESS
We consider 3 measures of correctness:

1.  assuming all the bugs were worked out, it could have produced the correct behavior 
  (i.e. the approach is a good one)
2.
  a) Allows some parallelism in consumers (but maybe has waits inappropriately sometimes)
  b) Always protects the same chunk from happening twice
3. It correctly runs for the given test cases (even if you adjust the parameters some)

if none of these 3 categories then 0 points for correctness (even if they seem to have 
  put forth effort)
if one of these 3 categories then 4 points
if it's two of these 3 categories they can get 6 points

8 points only if their solution would work 100% of the time

EXAMPLES:

Array of semaphores, but critical section is just around the actual step2 not selecting 
  a variable for step2 correctness 0/8
One thread handles odds, one thread handles evens, but output always looks right correctness 6/8
Semaphore init happens after threads start -2 mechanics 5/7


SOME EXAMPLE FEEDBACK

...just so you can see what I try to give to students


Example 1

STEP1 15/15.
STEP2 7/15
Correct use of semaphore synatax. +7
Not really a workable approach
Has possibility of same chunk being processed twice
Does not produce correct output


Example 2

STEP1 10/15
Approach pretty cool and innovative
Bug that caused segfault, works correctly if removed -5

Corrected lines (removed function calls):
  pthread_create(&thread,NULL,startProd, NULL);
  pthread_create(&consmthread,NULL,startConsm, NULL);


Example 3

beemanla
STEP1 15/15
STEP2 15/15 - nice!
