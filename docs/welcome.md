## Welcome Statement

I am very excited to have the opportunity to offer this class and canâ€™t wait to
meet you and get to know you. I hope that throughout the class, you will see
me as part of your support team. I strive to offer you a welcoming environment
where you can get help on course content, homework, or anything else really.
Studies conducted by me in my office show that coming to office hours
increases your chances of success.
