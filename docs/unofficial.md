## So what's this course about?
Have you ever wondered
* What the meaning of life is?
* Or can you ever really trust your senses?
* Or maybe you wondered if we have gotten rid of all mythologies and ideologies?

Well, unfortunately, this class is not going to help you answer any of those questions (_Hint_:
Answers are: I have no idea, nope, and definitely not).

But lucky for you, this class is going to help you answer the following questions:

* How can my machine run this many programs simultaneously while only having a limited amount of
resources (like CPU, memory, etc.)?
* How does my machine know when I insert a USB device? And then how does it know that I inserted a
mouse and not a keyboard?
* What happens when I write to file or create a new folder?
* What is up with that damned blue screen of death that has haunted you since childhood?
* How do I summon daemons? And what are they used for?
* When is it okay for a parent to kill its children? (and no this class has nothing to do with
witchcraft or satanic rituals)

In short, in this class, you will be exposed to the foundations of how machines run and how they
manage their resources efficiently (and sometimes, not so efficiently). 

## Why should I care?
I know by now that your brain is going 
>why do I care about how resources are managed? I just wanted to write Java or Python, do machine
learning, and earn the big bucks.

I totally understand and sympathize with you, that was my initial reaction as well. First, before I
try to convince you why this class is important, I would urge you to take an hour of your time to
watch [James Mickens' keynote talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGX7odA87k) at the Usenix
Security 2018 conference; it is hilarious but very informative and insightful. 

Now, back to our question. Imagine the following scenario: You have graduated from Rose, are now a
famous software developer, and are now on your way to buy your first house - How exciting! You find
a nice antique house that you like and decide to remodel it. You have full confidence in your
interior design and remodeling skills, you can afford all the fancy furniture and appliances you
like, but you don't really like thinking about the foundations of your house. So, deciding to be
practical, you just decide to ignore the foundations, decide that they work as they work, or in
other words, "the stuff is what the stuff is, brother!".

So now you're living in your dream house. Everything seems to be working correctly, you turn on the
faucet and the water flows, you plug things in and boom, they're powered on. That is all great until
one day, you start hearing weird noises, your pipes are creaking, your power is going crazy, and now
your fancy Jacuzzi is moving on its own. Well, what happened? By ignoring that foundation, you were
able to build a wonderful house that worked for a while, but then started falling apart. 

This is why I believe learning operating systems is important. The goal is not for you to become a
kernel developer (though I'd be super happy if you would and we will be friends!), but the aim is
for you to understand what's happening behind the scenes in your workstation. I strongly believe
that answering the questions above is crucial for you to become a well-versed software developer
that can write good and well-founded software. 

I personally absolutely LOVE this class and am very passionate about this subject. I hope that by
end of this quarter, I can convey some of my appreciation for this subject to you. When I learned
the concepts in this class, I gain an entire new appreciation for programming and the magic that
happens behind the scenes in our machines. Quoting one Reddit user, 
> A big brain moment for me was realizing how callbacks work and how I didn't need to write a main
    loop or anything like a regular program. Just set your hooks and let the OS call them.

## Why are there so many assignments and deadlines?
> It is one thing to learn concepts about operating systems, it is another to apply them in
practice. -- Your instructor

Our joint aim in this class is to get you to learn, experience, and appreciate the concepts the
define what an operating system is and does. That is we complement our theoretical (sometimes abstract)
concepts with hands-on assignments and a project that will solidify those concepts in your mind. In
other words, you will spend a lot of time learning by doing.

As for deadlines, if you are anything like me when I was in college, without set deadlines, you'll
procrastinate and play video games until you are running short on time and things have piled up (who
knew that time doesn't stop when I am playing video games \\\_(ツ)\_/ ). So deadlines are to help
you stay on top of your work and avoid falling behind and finding yourself in a pickle. For policies
and guidelines, see our official course syllabus at the top right corner.

## A statement on mental health
I know that as students, you are dealing with a lot of stress, often a lack of sleep, and sometimes
social isolation (especially in the COVID times). It is easy to neglect your mental (and physical)
health and lose yourself in the vortex of pressure. Spoken from experience, it is important for you
to *make time* for yourself, both mentally and physically. Therefore, if at any point during the
quarter, you feel that you are in need of help, please reach out to the [office of health
services](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/wellness-and-health-services/health-services/index.html)
or [the student counseling
center](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/wellness-and-health-services/counseling-services/index.html).
Also, if you feel comfortable, you can reach out to me so I can help you devise a plan to tackle your
coursework for CSSE 332. 

## Mystery Point
I bet you were wondering what is the mystery point about in the official syllabus. Well, here it is.
