# It can get annoying typing gcc commands every time we compile a 
# project, especially if the project is large and consists of several
# files.  Fortunately, there is a utility called "make" that can do 
# the compiling and linking for us.
# We only need to tell make what the files in the project are and 
# how they are related.  Make takes care of the rest.
# Make is so smart that if we modify a few files in a project, it 
# only recompiles those modified files and links them in the executable
# file.

# Running make:
# Make looks in the current directory for a file called Makefile or
# makefile for its build instructions. Run make by typing this command
# at the prompt. 
# >>> make <target>
# Makes takes 0 or typically 1 argument, which is a target.  

# Makefile:
# A makefile is made up of a series of variables and dependency rules 

## Variables:
## The name of the C compiler.  The default is gcc
CC = gcc

## List of options to pass to the C compiler for all your source files
## -g Tells compiler to include extra debugging informaton in its output
## -Wall Give warnings of constructs that look suspect
## -ansi gives warnings or errors if the code does not follow ANSI standards
CFLAGS = -g -Wall -ansi

## A list of options to pass to the linker.  We have an empty list in this
## case
LDFLAGS =

## Name the executable program
PROG = author

# Dependency Rules:
# A rule generally contains a dependency line and a command line
# dependency line <target>: <list_of_dependencies>
# command line \t<command>

## Build the program from the object files
$(PROG): main.o author.o
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) main.o author.o -o $(PROG)

## Rules for the source files.  They compile each X.c to make X.o
#
# NOTE: the reason we include author.h in the compilation of main.o is
# that if author.h changes, we need to rebuild main.c
main.o: main.c author.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.c -c -o main.o

author.o: author.c author.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) author.c -c -o author.o


## We also want to build and run unit tests for author.
#
# STEP 1: The unit tests are going to rely on CuTest.  Make a rule to
# build CuTest.o and make sure it works by running "make CuTest.o".
CuTest.o: CuTest.c CuTest.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) CuTest.c -c -o CuTest.o

# STEP 2: Ok.  Now we can build the unit tests.  This requries two
# things - building the .o file for unittest.c (note that cunit
# depends on both CuTest.h and author.h) and then linking author.o,
# CuUnit.o, and unittest.o into one executable.  You can name the test
# executable anything you like, except "test" (that will have a
# special meaning in STEP 3).  This will require two different rules.
# Be sure to test as you go!
unittest.o: CuTest.h author.h unittest.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) unittest.c -c -o unittest.o
unittest: CuTest.o author.o unittest.o 
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) CuTest.o author.o unittest.o -o unittest

# STEP 3: we want a rule test that will not produce a file but just
# run the unit tests.  That way by just saying "make test" you build
# anything that needs to build and run all the tests.
test: unittest
	./unittest

# STEP 4: let's add a final rule "make all".  This will make and run
# the unit tests plus build the main executable.  Then modify author.h
# and try a make all.  You should see it rebuild everything it needs
# to step by step.
all: test $(PROG)

## Remove all the compilation and debugging files
clean: 
	rm -f core $(PROG) unittest *.o *~
