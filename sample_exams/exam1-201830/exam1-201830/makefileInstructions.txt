# The exam code has 3 executables.  As a reminder, this is how you
# build each of them:
#
# gcc web-server.c -o server
# gcc server-admin.c -o server-admin
# gcc -pthread producer-consumer.c -o prodcon
#
# (5 points) 
# (a) Setup a makefile with the appropriate dependencies so that
# each of these executables is rebuilt when their corresponding c
# files is edited (and correspondingly, not rebuilt if they are up to
# date with their source files).  Because each executable has exactly one
# C file dependency, you don't need to separate compiling and linking into 
# two separate steps (though you can, if you wish).
#
# (b) setup an "all" rule so that "make all" builds all 3 executables.
#
# (c) setup a "clean" rule to remove all executables and emacs backup files.
