## Introduction and aim
We are going to do plenty of C programming in this class, and to do so, I believe it would be
helpful to have a refresher on pointers in C. 

In this short assignment, you will do some pointer practice to refresh your memory and bring out
some of the concepts you learned in CSSE 132 into your memory. If you remember all that well, I
would expect  it would take you about an hour to complete this assignment. If you syntax is a bit
rusty, then this will serve as great practice for the class.

## Problems and solving them
There are five problems of increasing difficulty with included test cases. The only file you need
to concern yourself with is `main.c`, but please do not edit any of the test cases. 

You can solve these problems in one of two ways:
1. If you've got a working C Linux environment, you can go ahead and get started directly. If you do
   not but are not afraid to install a Linux virtual machine (or in some other form), that will be
   one of the first things we do in class, so feel free to get a head start. 
2. You can also do this assignment completely online in a web-based C programming environment
   [here](https://repl.it/@RHITcsse/OSPointerPractice).

If you won't have time or computer access during the break, this assignment will be due on the
second day of the term (Friday), so you can try to squeeze it during our work time in class. If you
have any questions, please reach out via Email or Teams as soon as possible. 

## Submission
Once you complete the assignment, you can submit your code via moodle
[here](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=2708040&forceview=1).

For you convenience, here is a link to the [submission instructions]({{ site.baseurl
