# Activity A

Imagine these two thread functions run in parallel.  For various important reasons, t1 needs to do steps 1 and 3, and t2 needs to do step 2.  However, we need to ensure the steps always occur in order Step 1 - 3.  Add semaphores to the system to ensure the correct order:

    void* t1(void* ignored) {
        printf("step 1\n");
        printf("step 3\n");
    }
    
    void* t2(void* ignored) {
        printf("step 2\n");
    }


# Activity B

Imagine there an is a train junction, where a north south track
intersects an east west track.  Here are the rules:

i.	You can assume, due to other protections in the system, that there
    is only 1 north/south thread and one east/west thread running at
    one time.  After one north/south train passes through the
    junction, though, another may be started and wish to pass though,
    etc.

ii.	Trains are long, and they take a while to move through the
    junction.  While a north/south train is in the junction, an east
    west train must not enter the junction.  The rule is the same for
    east/west trains. 
    
Your goal in this part is not to solve the problem.  Instead, your
goal is to look at the various code solutions below and explain
why they do not work.  Assume all variables are global, assume all
semaphores are initialized to 1.

1.

    while(train_in_junction == 1);
    train_in_junction = 1;
    enter_junction();
    train_in_junction = 0;

Both nw and ew can pass through the while loop, and then set
train\_in\_junction = 1 at the same time.

2.
    
    // code for north south trains
    sem_wait(&ns_sem);
    enter_junction();
    sem_post(&ns_sem);
    // code for east west trains in the same, but they have their 
    // own ew_sem semaphore

Because nw and ew have their own semaphores, they don't affect each
other.  Therefore nw can aquire ns\_sem, ew can aquire ew\_sem and they
both enter the critical section.

3.

    while(1) {
        sem_wait(&sem);
        if(train_in_junction == 0)
            sem_post(&sem);
            break;
        sem_post(&sem);
    }
    sem_wait(&sem)
    train_in_junction = 1;
    sem_post(&sem);
    enter_junction();
    sem_wait(&sem)
    train_in_junction = 0;
    sem_post(&sem);

The issue here is that although the wait before if statement ensures
only 1 thread can check train\_in\_junction = 0 at one time, after
discovering train\_in\_junction is 0, the thread posts the
semaphore...allowing the other thread to check train\_in\_junction
before it is set to 1.

4.

    sem_wait(&sem)
    while(train_in_junction == 1);
    train_in_junction = 1;
    sem_post(&sem);
    enter_junction();
    sem_wait(&sem)
    train_in_junction = 0;
    sem_post(&sem);


The issue here is a deadlock.  If nw enters the junction and then ew
gets trapped in the while loop, ew has the semaphore that nw needs to
unlock train\_in\_junction.
