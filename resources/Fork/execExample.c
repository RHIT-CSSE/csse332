       This form always takes 2 arguments, but the 2nd argument is a
       NULL terminated array of arguments.  Because building the array
       is an extra step, this form is usually annoying unless you need
       to be able to vary how many arguments you pass programmatically
       (i.e. you don't know how many args there will be when you write
       the exec command). */

    /* Option 3: execlp 

       Same as above, but we don't need to say /bin/ because its on
       our path.  Note that in this class, we frequently execute stuff
       in the local directory (e.g. "./someProg") in that case execlp
       and excecl are equivalent. */

       to tell the executing program its first parameter is (first
       parameter is always the name of the executable).
