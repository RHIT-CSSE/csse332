  Added links to homepage for C review and bash crash course.

  * index.md:
    - Added two new set of links there to point to Moodle.
    - These contain C review material that we don't have time to go over in
      class.
    - Also includes a quick bash crash course for those who are not comfortable
      with a terminal window.

  Made changes to the schedule up to week 7.

  * _data/schedule.yml:
    - Because of the break, it doesn't make sense to split exam 1, a part before
      break and one two weeks later, so I put them back to back.
    - Had to do the same for exam 2 since we also lose a day for MLK day being a
      holiday now.
    - Had to remove heap manager II because of the lost lab day, we now do heap
      manager I and then directly COW.
      - We might replace one or both of these with ELF if done in time.
    - Exam 2 is now week 7 back to back, similar to exam 1, so we can start the
      project on week 8 and have three weeks for it.
    - We are left with three lab dates, which we can consider what to introduce
      there. We have the scheduling activity (simple), ext2 (nice), and stack
      smashing (might nix this), and userspace threads (xv6 and userspace
      versions), and userspace threads 2 (only userspace version beacuse no
      signals in xv6).
    - Added worksheets and solutions links to the schedule.
