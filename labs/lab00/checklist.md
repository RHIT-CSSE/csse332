# Lab Specifications

To determine which letter grade you shall receive on your submission, the
graders will use the following specifications: 

1. The submission compiles successfully and boots into xv6. 
2. The submission correctly creates, destroys, and dereferences pointers to meet
   the design specifications. 
3. The submission correctly creates, destroys, and accesses C structures to
   implement an dynamically re-sizable array list. 
4. The submission makes use of system calls to obtain system-related
   information.
5. The submission makes use of system calls to perform privileged services on
   behalf of the user. 
6. The submission checks for common errors and displays proper error messages
   when encountered. 
7. The code is properly commented and readable. 


# Grading Scheme

In this class, we will generally try to follow the __EMRN__ grading rubric as
shown in the figure below.

![EMRN]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/EMRN-rubric-2020.png)

In addition to a numeric value on your lab, you will receive a letter indicating
the grader's level of confidence in your abilities based on your performance in
the lab. You should treat the grader's feedback as an indicator of how well you
are performing in class, in terms of understanding the basic concepts in lecture
and applying them to the exercises in the laboratory assignments. Consistent
performance on the lab exercises is a good predictor of your performance on the
skill exams. 

You can receive one of four letter grades:
1. **E**: Your work meets all of the laboratory's specifications and indicates
   an excellent understanding of the course material. Keep it up!
2. **M**: Your work meets the minimum specifications. It shows a satisfactory
   level of understanding though some gaps might still be present. You're in
   decent enough shape in the class.
3. **R**: Your work does not satisfy the minimum specifications for the lab
   assignment and thus requires revision. Your work shows significant gaps in
   your understanding of the class concepts. You should plan to meet with your
   instructor to devise a plan to address those gaps. 
4. **N**: Your work is not assessable, in the sense that you submitted empty
   code, code does that not compile, or code that does not perform the
   functionalities specified in the lab documentation. There are too many issues
   with your submission to justify grading it. You definitely should plan to
   meet with your instructor to devise a plan to recover and address your
   performance in the class.
