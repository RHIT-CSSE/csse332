/**
  This system has four threads: the duck, cat, and dog that eat 
  bread, and the little red hen that makes the bread. The little
  red hen makes seven loaves per batch, but she only has the patience
  for six batches. The little red hen only makes a batch if there are
  no loaves left.

  The other three animals each want to eat 14 loaves of
  bread, but only one of them can be in the kitchen at a time (to avoid
  fights over who gets what bread).

  When the duck, cat, or dog notices that there are no loaves of bread
  available, they complain to the little red hen and wait (in the kitchen)
  for the next batch to be ready.

  Use mutex locks and condition variables to enforce this constraint. Note: the
  global numLoaves variable should be left as is.

  look at littleRedHenSampleOutput.txt for an example correct output
  sequence
