Welcome to CSSE 332, Operating Systems.

* You can find the official syllabus [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/) or on
  the top right.
* We strongly suggest that you read the unofficial syllabus [here]({{
  site.baseurl }}/docs/unofficial/).
* Instructor information and welcome statement can be found [here]({{
  site.baseurl }}/docs/welcome/).

## Before coming to the first class

Before coming to the first class, please make sure to read the
[syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus) and the [unofficial syllabus]({{
  site.baseurl }}/docs/unofficial). Then,
skim through the [WSL2 installation instructions](./labs/wsl/) to make sure you
are ready for the first day of class. 

After you have WSL2 installed, it might be worth it to note that this entire
site and course content are self-contained in a `git` [repository]({{
  site.gh_repository_url  }}). Feel free to check it out and poke around! 

Then, to get a head start on your assignments, please take a moment to create a
private repository to host your code for the quarter. It is easy to set up a
private repository that pulls changes from the public course repository and
pushes your modifications to your personal private repository. You can find
instructions on how to set it up for the course content repository
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/making_a_private_repo).

You might also find it useful to setup another private repository for the
course's xv6 laboratories
[repository](https://github.com/rhit-csse332/xv6-riscv-public) using the same
instructions above.
