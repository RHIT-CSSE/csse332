* You can find the official syllabus [here]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/docs/syllabus/syllabus) or on the top right.
* We strongly suggest that you read the unofficial syllabus [here]({{
  site.baseurl }}/docs/syllabus/unofficial/).
* Instructor information can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/docs/instructors/).

## Before coming to the first class

Before coming to the first class, please make sure to read the
[syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/syllabus/syllabus)\* and the [unofficial
syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/syllabus/unofficial).

After you have read the syllabus, please make sure to look at the following
steps:

  1. Set yourself up with a working Linux distribution. If you are on a Windows
     machine, you can follow these [instructions](./labs/wsl) to install `WSL2`.
     
     > Note: Although MacOS is a Unix-based distribution, there are significant
       differences in behavior that we have observed between current version of
       Linux and mac. Therefore, please make sure you are on a Linux machine to
       d your work locally.

  2. Create your private repository that will host your solutions for the labs
     in this class, by following the instructions [here](./docs/setup).

  3. Re-familiarize yourself with terminal-based editors, as you will have to
     use it for taking the exam (No IDEs allowed!). In the [resources
     page]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.resourcespath}}), we provide you with a useful
     `vim` configuration file and some tips and tricks for using `vim` to write
     your code.

\* This offering of CSSE332 includes several major changes from previous
offerings, so please make sure you read the syllabus carefully.


<!--
After you have WSL2 installed, it might be worth it to note that this entire
site and course content are self-contained in a `git` [repository]({{
  site.gh_repository_url  }}). Feel free to check it out and poke around! 

Then, to get a head start on your assignments, please take a moment to create a
private repository to host your code for the quarter. It is easy to set up a
private repository that pulls changes from the public course repository and
pushes your modifications to your personal private repository. You can find
instructions on how to set it up for the course content repository
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/making_a_private_repo).

You might also find it useful to setup another private repository for the
course's xv6 laboratories
[repository](https://github.com/rhit-csse332/xv6-riscv-public) using the same
instructions above.
